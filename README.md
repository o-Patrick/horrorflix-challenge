# Horrorflix (challenge)
 Website project developed throughout the "Recriando a Interface do Netflix" (Recreating Netflix's Interface) challenge on DIO (Digital Innovation One).
 
 This page was -- as you might have guessed from the last paragraph -- created based on Netflix's home page. The technologies used are:
 - HTML5;
 - CSS3;
 - JavaScript or [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) (built with jQuery) to be more specific although it's deprecated now.
 
 The sole purpose of this website is for training my habilities, which means I do not claim property of any of the movies (or their posters) shown.
 
 Want to check it out? Then [click here!]()
 
 NOTE: All posters and the overview for Scream were taken from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Truly appreciate their work!
 
 NOTE1: Also be careful with the movies, they're highly not reccomended for the weak hearted (or stomached? :thinking:).
 
 NOTE2: I still want to upgrade this project with more posters and a page dedicated to each one sooo... maybe stay tuned? Or nah, it may take some time...
